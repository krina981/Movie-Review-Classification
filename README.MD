# Movie Review Classification
## Overview
Welcome to the "Movie Review Classification" project! This repository contains Python code and Jupyter notebooks for building a text classification model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to create a sentiment analysis model.

## Problem Statement
The main objective of this project is to develop a robust text classification model that can accurately predict whether a given movie review expresses a positive or negative sentiment. The dataset used for training contains movie reviews along with their corresponding sentiment labels. The model will learn from this labeled data to classify new, unseen movie reviews in the future.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of movie reviews collected from various sources. Each review is labeled as either "positive" or "negative" based on the overall sentiment expressed in the text. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set for model development and evaluation.

## Goals
The main goals of this project are as follows:

Data Preprocessing: Perform text preprocessing steps such as tokenization, lowercasing, removing stop words, and applying stemming or lemmatization.
Feature Extraction: Convert the preprocessed text data into numerical feature vectors suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Model Building: Implement a text classification algorithm, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), to create the sentiment analysis model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the sentiment analysis model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model by tuning hyperparameters to achieve better classification results.
Prediction: Use the trained model to classify new movie reviews as positive or negative.
Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset files (if not too large) or links to the dataset source.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model implementation, and evaluation.
src/: Python scripts containing reusable functions for text processing and model implementation.
results/: Saved model, performance metrics, and visualizations.
report/: A detailed report summarizing the model's performance and insights.
## Usage
To run the movie review classification model on the provided dataset, you will need Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using the requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
After installing the required libraries, you can use the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to preprocess the text data, build the classification model, and evaluate its performance.
